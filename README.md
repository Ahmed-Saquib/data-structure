# data-structure

There are two type of Data structures,
* Primitive data structure
* Non-primitive data structure

### Primitive data structure

* Primitive data stuctures are primitive data types which can hold a single value. Example: int, char, double, boolean, float, etc.

### Non-primitive data structure

* Non-primitive data structures are non-primitive data types which can hold multiple values. Example, array, list, stack, queue, graph, tree, etc.

* Non-primitive data stuctures are devided into two types.
  
  * Linear data structure
  * Non-linear data structure
  
  #### Linear data structure
  
  Linear data structure is a type of data structure where data/elements are stored/arranged in a sequential manner, such that each element is connected to it's previous and next element. Example: array, stack, queue, linked list.
  
  #### Non-linear data structure
  
  Non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where data/elements are not stored/arranged in a sequential manner as each element can be connected to two or more elements. Example: graph, tree.
