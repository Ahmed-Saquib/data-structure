# DSA Q&A

#### Why you should use linked list over array?
* The size of an array must be known in advance.
* Increasing the size of an array is time consuming.
* Inserting an element in the array needs shifting of all its predecessors.
On the otherhand,
* Linked list allocates memory dynamically. 
* Inserting an element doesn't demand a lot of process like array.
There are some disadvantages also,
* In linked list nodes occupy more memory than array. 
* Traversal is not easy in a linked list. Can access an element randomly. For example, if we need to access the 3rd node then we need to traverse all the nodes before it.
