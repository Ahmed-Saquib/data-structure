# data-structure

There are two type of Data structures,
* Primitive data structure
* Non-primitive data structure

### Primitive data structure

* Primitive data stuctures are primitive data types which can hold a single value. Example: int, char, double, boolean, float, etc.

### Non-primitive data structure

* Non-primitive data structures are non-primitive data types which can hold multiple values. Example, array, list, stack, queue, graph, tree, etc.

* Non-primitive data stuctures are devided into two types.
  
  * Linear data structure
  * Non-linear data structure
  
  #### Linear data structure
  
  Linear data structure is a type of data structure where data/elements are stored/arranged in a sequential manner, such that each element is connected to it's previous and next element. Example: array, stack, queue, linked list.
  
  #### Non-linear data structure
  
  Non-linear data structure is a type of data structure where data/elements are stored/arranged in a hierarchical manner such that each element can be connected to two or more elements. Example: graph, tree.
  
  #### Differences between linear and non-linear data structure
   
   * Basic
     * In linear data structure the elements are stored/arranged sequentially/linearly.
     * In non-linear data structure the elements are stored/arranged hierarchically/non-linearly.
   * Traversal
     * It needs a single run to traverse through all elements in a linear data structure as elements are arranged sequentially.
     * It needs multiple run to traverse throuugh all elements in a non linear daa structure aas elements are arranged hierarchically. 
   * Arrangement
     * In linear data structure elements are connected to its previous and next element.
     * In non-linear data structure elements can be connected to multiple elements.
   * Memory Utilization
     * Linear data structure can't utilize memeory effeciently as it requires memory allocation in advance.
     * Non-linear data structure can utilize memory efficiently as it doesn't require memory allocation in advance.
   * Time complexity
     * Time complexity increases in a linear data structure as the number of input size increases.
     * Time complexity in a non-linear data structure often remains the same as the input size increases.
